Grab a latte at <strong>Café Belong</strong> and stroll on the boardwalk, or if it’s a Sunday, browse the local offerings at the weekly farmer’s market. Head back downtown along the Bayview extension and Rosedale Valley Road, which winds through a leafy ravine. Thanks to Torque Vectoring Control, you\'ll enjoy the the Stinger\'s race-inspired handling, cornering and stability in the turns before exiting towards Bloor Street\'s Mink Mile.</p><p>Past the <strong>Royal Ontario Museum</strong>, the <strong>Gardiner Museum</strong> and the <strong>Bata Shoe Museum</strong>, continue along to Sterling Road, a former industrial area now home to the citys newest art institution. The <strong>Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA)</strong> opened this spring in the historic Tower Automotive Building and focuses on work by Canadian artists, with an ever-changing schedule of temporary exhibits. Afterwards, head down the block to the <strong>Drake Commissary</strong>, a restaurant, bar and bakery, for a lunch of internationally influenced, locally sourced cuisine like Swedish smorrebrod with prawns and avocado or pizza bianca with lamb and Quebecois Sauvagine cheese. </p><p>Fortified by art and food, drive south to the Lakeshore and back across the city, for your last stop of the day. Located in the heart of the financial district, <strong>Garrison Bespoke</strong> is a custom tailor specializing in performance tailoring. Thanks to owner Michael Nguyen\'s love of old-school craftsmanship and innovative fabrics, it\'s the perfect balance of classic and modern.',
